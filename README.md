Summaries of my pinned repos:

## WEBVULTURE
- __Project summary__: online automated SQL injection tool with various parameters. Scrapes all potential injection points (e.g., forms) and uses SQLMap on those points. Displays results and terminal outputs on the web page.
- __What I did__: built the backend using FastAPI to pass user inputs from the frontend to the backend Python script and to pass terminal outputs of the Python script to the frontend in real-time using SSE. Also wrote a few frontend-independent HTTP request tests that do not appear on GitHub.
- __Skills used__: Python, FastAPI, HTTP, React.js
