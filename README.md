Summaries of my pinned repos:

## WEBVULTURE (McHacks 12)
- __Project summary__: online automated SQL injection tool with various parameters. Scrapes all potential injection points (e.g., forms) and uses SQLMap on those points. Displays results and terminal outputs on the web page.
- __What I did__: built the backend using FastAPI to pass user inputs from the frontend to the backend Python script and to pass terminal outputs of the Python script to the frontend in real-time using SSE. Also wrote a few frontend-independent HTTP request tests that do not appear on GitHub.
- __Skills used__: Python, FastAPI, HTTP, React.js

## Sheep in Sheep's Clothing (McGameJam 2025)
- __Project summary__: First game made with fellow partners from the McGill Game Dev club over the weekend. Simple 2D game where the goal is to send as many sheep to the barn located in the center as you can before you run out of coins and the sheep flames you for being bad.
- __What I did__: Did all of the main menu UI, persistent user settings, as well as audio integration.
- __Skills used__: Unity Engine, C#

## GDM Studios _(WIP)_
- __Project summary__: A much longer project (weekly updates until end of March) I'm making with the same fellas as McGameJam. Will add game summary once there's actual playable features.
- __What I will do__: Pretty sure I'll end up doing the same things as in McGameJam, just to a much larger scale. We'll see what else I get to do.
- - __Skills used__: Unity Engine, C#
