Summaries of my pinned repos:

## GDM Studios _(WIP)_
- __Project summary__: A much longer project (weekly updates until end of March) I'm making with the same fellas as McGameJam. It will be a platformer with story elements. Looking forward to the reveal in March!
- __What I will do / What I did__: Everything that's UI / settings / main menu. Will update art and sound soon.
- __Languages__: Unity Engine, C#

- __CURRENT BUILD__: https://yxl05.itch.io/gdm-studios-team-4-progress
> Cool stuff I did: a level selector with persistent user settings that can easily be scaled, pause menu with attempts tracker, loading screen (for scalability).

## Sheep in Sheep's Clothing (McGameJam 2025)
- __Project summary__: First game made with fellow partners from the McGill Game Dev club over the weekend. Simple 2D game where the goal is to send as many sheep to the barn located in the center as you can before you run out of coins and the sheep flames you for being bad.
- __What I did__: Did all of the main menu UI (engine and code wise), persistent user settings, as well as audio integration.
- __Languages__: Unity Engine, C#

- __GAME__: https://tr-r.itch.io/sheep-in-sheeps-clothing

## "Handy" Presentation Helper
> Was supposed to be for VanierHacks but that turned out to be a CTF so this is now a personal group project.
- __Project summary__: WPF-based presentation helper for Office 365 apps (might extend to web apps by building a Chrome extension or other platforms using MAUI) using ML-based hand gesture recognition (not my own, though I had to tweak it for my own needs).
- __What I did__: project is still in its early stages. So far, I tweaked some parts of the ML code and trained it for my own set of gestures. Working on the C# microapp currently.
- __Languages__: C# (.NET), Python

## WEBVULTURE (McHacks 12)
- __Project summary__: online automated SQL injection tool with various parameters. Scrapes all potential injection points (e.g., forms) and uses SQLMap on those points. Displays results and terminal outputs on the web page.
- __What I did__: built the backend using FastAPI to pass user inputs from the frontend to the backend Python script and to pass terminal outputs of the Python script to the frontend in real-time using SSE. Also wrote a few frontend-independent HTTP request tests that do not appear on GitHub. Also dabbled with some frontend adjustments towards the end.
- __Languages__: Python (FastAPI), React.js, CSS
